Dear brothers and sisters, I was named after the inspirational Malala of my one, who is the Pashtun John of Arc. The word Malala means grief-stricken, sad. But in order to lend some happiness to it, my grandfather would always call me Malala, the happiest girl in the world. And today, I'm very happy that we are together fighting for an important cause.
